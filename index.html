    <h2 style="color:red">CLIMATE OF THE UKRAINIAN CARPATHIANS</h2>
    <p><i><b>The Carpathians</b></i> are located in a moderate continental temperate zone.<br>
    The <b>winters</b> are mild with temperatures usually below freezing but not frigid.<br>
    <b>Winter</b> usually sets in in December and lasts till late March, with near continuous<br> 
    snow cover for elevations over 800 m. Recently, winters have been warmer<br>
    and the snow has arrived later.</p>

    <p>Spring in the Carpathians it is amazing time of nature waking up from<br>
    long winter dream. Snow melts, springs wake up and start chasing each other,<br>
    birds sing and spring sun warms!</p>

    <p>And the <b>summers</b> are warm but not excessively hot.<br>
    Precipitation is abundant, but it is far from a rain forest. 
    <b>Summers</b> see humid weather<br>
    and plenty of thunderstorms, during which one must stay off the peaks and ridges. <br>
    Biting flies can be a nuisance in areas.</p>

    <p><b>Fall</b> temperatures are cool. And the <b>autumn</b> colors<br>
    are brilliant in places, particularly west of the watershed where deciduous<br>
    trees are more prevalent.</p>
